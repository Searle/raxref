This is the first version, but it works very good.
And it's REALLY REALLY simple to use, I swear!

TBD

Stuff:

- Only tested with FF3 3.0.7 and Safari 3.2.2 !!!

- Raxref is written in Perl 5 and JavaScript
- Made to understand the Parrot Project
- Makes use of some CSS 2 features that most browsers don't support

TODO by priority:
- JS: Add quick search
- CSS: Finish color coding
- JS: Add Slot resizing
- Add a simple possibility to build a rexref web app without a conf file
  e.g. raxref --source some/path (auto-include conf/std.conf)
- JS: Add "new source window", "new xref window"
- Add Project Meta Info e.g 'meta author Blah', 'meta url parrot.org'...

TODO misc, unsorted:
- Add Project description
- HTML Encoding
- Tab expansion: Use MXR code
- Analyse Shebang for file type detection
- Force analysis if conf file changes
- Optimize File scanning for PHP
- Fix the FIXMEs
- Include Raxref Version in output
- Add conf directive for sections: "filetypes c99 perl php html"
- Make conf direcive 'token_threshold' section-specific
